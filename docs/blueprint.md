# **App Name**: ProCognito

## Core Features:

- Anomaly Detection: Employ machine learning models to detect unusual patterns in network traffic, flagging potential threats in real-time.
- Reinforcement Learning Defense: Use reinforcement learning to allow the system to learn from previous cyber threats, adapting its defense strategies automatically to improve resilience.
- NLP Security Log Analysis: Analyze security logs and user activity through NLP, providing early warnings and insights into potential security breaches by correlating textual data with threat patterns.
- Adaptive Agent Orchestration: Deploy a team of AI agents, with each agent performing a specialized tool: detecting threats, analyzing risks, and coordinating responses dynamically.
- Real-time Threat Alerts: Implement a real-time alerting system that notifies security personnel of potential threats detected by the AI, reducing response time.
- Interactive Threat Visualization: Visualize complex threat data in an accessible, interactive dashboard to help analysts understand and respond to potential cyberattacks.
- Automated Defensive Actions: Set up automated defensive responses to confirmed threats, isolating compromised systems or blocking malicious traffic to prevent further damage.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep electric blue (#4169E1), reflecting intelligence, security, and trust.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#E6E8FA) to ensure a professional and secure aesthetic.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#B19CD9) for less critical UI elements and subtle highlights, harmonizing with the deep electric blue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a modern, clean, and objective design, readable at various sizes for efficient data processing and review.
- Use sharp, precise icons that convey digital security and AI, ensuring clarity.
- Design a clean, structured layout optimized for data-rich visualizations. Prioritize real-time alerts and anomaly highlights to minimize analysis time.
- Incorporate subtle animations to indicate AI activity, like loading indicators during threat analysis, without disrupting focus.
